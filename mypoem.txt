"Birds sing melodies of love,
While clouds drift lazily above.
In this world of wonder and delight,
Every moment is pure and bright."

Life's a journey, wild and free,
Filled with joy and mystery.
So let us cherish every day,
And let our dreams light up the way.

In fields of gold, the sun does dance,
you are my life love
